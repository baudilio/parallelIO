#+TITLE: Exercise parallel IO using OpenMPI

* Introduction

This repository is intended to study simple methods of parallel IO.

Tools: OpenMPI, F90, SLURM


* Write multiple ASCII files

Here I will study how to write multiple -~in parallel~- simple ASCII files so that I can inspect their content and asses it for consistency with the procedures in the code.c
